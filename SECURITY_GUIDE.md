# VAWC App Security Guide

## Overview
This document outlines the security measures implemented in the Barangay San Pedro VAWC (Violence Against Women and Children) complaint system.

## Security Features Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Encryption
- **AES-256-GCM**: Replaced weak AES-CBC with authenticated encryption
- **Secure Key Generation**: Cryptographically secure random keys generated at runtime
- **Input Sanitization**: All user inputs are sanitized before encryption
- **No Hardcoded Keys**: Removed predictable encryption keys from local.properties

### 2. Input Validation
- **Name Validation**: Regex pattern for names (letters, spaces, hyphens, apostrophes)
- **Phone Validation**: International phone number format support
- **Age Validation**: Numeric range validation (1-120)
- **Address Validation**: Safe character set for addresses
- **Length Limits**: Maximum 100 characters per field

### 3. Network Security
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: All network traffic uses HTTPS
- **Certificate Pinning**: Firebase certificates are pinned
- **No Cleartext Traffic**: Disabled HTTP traffic
- **Network Security Config**: Enforced secure connections

### 4. Data Protection
- **No Cloud Backup**: Sensitive data excluded from Android backup
- **No Device Transfer**: VAWC data excluded from device transfers
- **ProGuard Obfuscation**: Code obfuscation in release builds
- **Log Removal**: Debug logs removed in production

### 5. Firebase Security
- **Authentication Required**: All operations require Firebase Auth
- **Firestore Rules**: Server-side validation and access control
- **No Deletion**: Complaints cannot be deleted (audit trail)
- **Data Validation**: Server-side validation of complaint structure

## Implementation Details

### SecurityManager Class
```kotlin
// Key features:
- AES-256-GCM encryption
- Secure random key generation
- Input validation patterns
- App integrity verification
- Secure ID generation
```

### EnhancedEncryptionTransit Class
```kotlin
// Enhanced features:
- Input sanitization before encryption
- Comprehensive validation
- Error handling and logging
- Type-safe encryption methods
```

### Validation Patterns
```kotlin
// Name: ^[a-zA-Z\s\-']{1,50}$
// Phone: ^[+]?[0-9\s\-()]{7,15}$
// Age: ^[0-9]{1,3}$ (1-120)
// Address: ^[a-zA-Z0-9\s\-.,'()]{1,100}$
```

## Security Best Practices

### 1. For Development
- Never commit encryption keys to version control
- Use debug builds for testing
- Enable ProGuard for release builds
- Test security features thoroughly

### 2. For Production
- Create a release keystore
- Use Firebase App Check
- Monitor Firebase usage
- Regular security audits
- Update dependencies regularly

### 3. For Deployment
- Deploy Firestore security rules
- Configure Firebase Authentication
- Set up Firebase App Check
- Monitor for suspicious activity

## Firebase Configuration

### 1. Firestore Rules
Deploy the `firestore.rules` file to your Firebase project:
```bash
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

### 2. Authentication Setup
- Enable Anonymous Authentication in Firebase Console
- Configure App Check for additional security
- Monitor authentication attempts

### 3. Security Monitoring
- Set up Firebase Analytics for usage monitoring
- Configure Firebase Crashlytics for error tracking
- Monitor Firestore usage and costs

## Compliance Considerations

### 1. Data Privacy
- All personal data is encrypted at rest
- No data is backed up to cloud services
- Complaints are stored securely in Firebase
- Access is restricted to authenticated users

### 2. Legal Requirements
- VAWC data retention policies
- Audit trail maintenance
- Secure data transmission
- User consent and awareness

### 3. Barangay Requirements
- Local data protection compliance
- Government security standards
- Community privacy expectations
- Legal case management requirements

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Encryption Errors**: Check SecurityManager initialization
2. **Validation Failures**: Verify input format requirements
3. **Network Errors**: Check certificate pinning configuration
4. **Firebase Errors**: Verify authentication and rules

### Debug Mode
- Security checks are relaxed in debug builds
- Logging is enabled for troubleshooting
- Certificate pinning is disabled for development

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Advanced Security
- Biometric authentication
- Multi-factor authentication
- Advanced threat detection
- Secure key storage (Android Keystore)

### 2. Compliance Features
- Data retention policies
- Automated audit logging
- Compliance reporting
- Legal hold capabilities

### 3. User Experience
- Secure offline mode
- Encrypted local storage
- Secure data export
- Privacy controls

## Support and Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- Update dependencies monthly
- Review security logs weekly
- Monitor Firebase usage
- Backup security configurations

### Emergency Procedures
- Revoke compromised keys
- Update security rules
- Notify affected users
- Document incidents
